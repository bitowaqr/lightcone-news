      <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent (Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR):</strong> Where you have given clear consent for us to process your personal data for a specific purpose (e.g., subscribing to a newsletter, non-essential cookies, using specific AI interaction data for improvement). You can withdraw your consent at any time.</li>
        <li><strong>Contract Performance (Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR):</strong> Where processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are party or in order to take steps at your request prior to entering into a contract (e.g., creating and maintaining your user account, providing the core functionalities of the Service).</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Obligation (Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR):</strong> Where processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation to which we are subject (e.g., tax laws, responding to legal requests).</li>

      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">How We Use Your Personal Data</h2>

        <li>For analytics and measurement to understand how our Services are used.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">Data Sharing and Disclosure</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We do not sell your Personal Data. We may share your Personal Data in the following limited circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers (Processors):</strong> We may employ third-party companies and individuals to facilitate our Service, provide the Service on our behalf, perform Service-related services, or assist us in analyzing how our Service is used (e.g., hosting providers, email service providers like AWS SES, analytics providers, AI model providers like Google and OpenAI). These third parties act as Processors and have access to your Personal Data only to perform these tasks on our behalf and are obligated not to disclose or use it for any other purpose, under contractual agreements compliant with GDPR Art. 28.</li>
        <li><strong>AI Feature Providers:</strong> When you interact with AI features, your input data may be sent to third-party AI model providers (e.g., Google, OpenAI) to generate a response. We rely on the privacy policies and data processing agreements of these providers. We aim to minimize the personal data sent and will seek specific consent if providers intend to use input data for model training.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose your Personal Data if required to do so by law or in response to valid requests by public authorities (e.g., a court or a government agency), or to protect and defend our rights or property, prevent fraud, or protect the personal safety of users or the public.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> If we are involved in a merger, acquisition, or asset sale, your Personal Data may be transferred as part of that transaction. We will provide notice before your Personal Data is transferred and becomes subject to a different Privacy Policy.</li>
        <li><strong>With Your Consent:</strong> We may disclose your personal information for any other purpose with your explicit consent.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">International Data Transfers</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to — and maintained on — computers located outside of your state, province, country, or other governmental jurisdiction where the data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction. If you are located in the European Economic Area (EEA), your Personal Data may be transferred to countries outside the EEA, such as the United States, where some of our Service Providers may be located. </p>
      <p class="mb-4">We will take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that your data is treated securely and in accordance with this Privacy Policy. For transfers outside the EEA, we rely on adequacy decisions by the European Commission where applicable, or implement appropriate safeguards such as Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs) approved by the European Commission, along with supplementary measures as necessary, to ensure a level of data protection equivalent to that required by GDPR.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">Data Retention</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">We will retain your Personal Data only for as long as is necessary for the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. We will retain and use your Personal Data to the extent necessary to comply with our legal obligations (for example, if we are required to retain your data to comply with applicable laws), resolve disputes, and enforce our legal agreements and policies.</p>
      <p class="mb-4">Account information is typically retained for the duration your account is active and for a reasonable period thereafter for administrative purposes or as required by law. Usage data and logs may be retained for shorter periods for analysis and security purposes, typically anonymized or aggregated where possible after the initial necessity period.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">Data Security</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">The security of your data is important to us. We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures designed to protect the security of any personal information we process. These measures include, but are not limited to, encryption, access controls, secure password hashing, and regular security assessments. However, please also remember that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your Personal Data, we cannot guarantee its absolute security.</p>

      <h2 class="mt-8 text-xl mb-2">Your Data Protection Rights under GDPR</h2>
